# Lesson 2: Bayesian Inference for continuous variables

This lesson aims to present a continuous version of Bayes' Rule with and without conjugacy. 

## 2.1 Elicitation and Conjugacy

## 2.2 Conjugate families
The property that the posterior distribution follows the same parametric form as the prior distribution is called **conjugacy**. In other words, if the posterior distributions p(θ | x) are in the same probability distribution family as the prior probability distribution p(θ), the prior and posterior are then called conjugate distributions, and the prior is called a conjugate prior for the likelihood function p(x | θ).

## 2.3 Credible Intervals and Inference
