# Introduction

## Bayes' rule
Conditional probability is the starting point for understanding Bayesian thinking and is widely used in disease testing. During early 1980s, ELISA was comnonlly used to test whether a patient had HIV or not. However, ELISA is not 100% accurate, because some tests result in false positives and false negatives. This was really problematic until the invention of Western Blot tests, in which the chances of error are lower. 

Consider the following probabilities:
- True positive rate: P(ELISA+âˆ£HIV+)
